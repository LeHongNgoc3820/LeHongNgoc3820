## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ngoc (Lucas)

I am a Bachelor of Finance - Banking. My major in college was Quantitative Finance. It's a major that combines economics, finance, statistical probabilities, and programming. I think this is a difficult and interesting major. Therefore, I decided to pursue it seriously because I love challenges and discovering new things.

+ Now, I'm a **Data Analyst**.
+ I am also an economic researcher. You can view my published research papers [here](https://github.com/LeHongNgoc3820/Paper-public).
+ In addition, I have also a passion for blogging.
