## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ngoc (Lucas)

+ I am a Bachelor of Finance - Banking. My major in college was Quantitative Finance. It's a major that combines economics, finance, statistical probabilities, and programming. I think this is a difficult, interesting, and challenging major. Therefore, I decided to pursue it seriously.

+ Now, I'm a Data Analyst.

+ I am also an economic researcher. You can view my published research papers [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T8vvLIAlmfqMDtRZaMVRH1ihEpL7jpnO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118190822169210067132&rtpof=true&sd=true).
